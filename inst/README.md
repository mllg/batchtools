As a successor of the packages BatchJobs and BatchExperiments, batchtools provides a parallel implementation of Map for high performance computing systems managed by schedulers like SLURM, Torque, or SGE.
Moreover, the package provides an abstraction mechanism to define large-scale computer experiments in a well-organized and reproducible way.

The development is still in alpha phase.
