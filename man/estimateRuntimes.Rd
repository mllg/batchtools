\title{Estimate Remaining Runtimes}
\usage{
estimateRuntimes(tab, ..., reg = getDefaultRegistry())

\method{print}{RuntimeEstimate}(x, n = 1L, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{tab}{[\code{\link{data.table}}]\cr
Table with column \dQuote{job.id} and additional columns to predict the runtime.
Observed runtimes will be looked up in the registry and serve as dependent variable.
All columns in \code{tab} except \dQuote{job.id} will be passed to \code{\link[ranger]{ranger}} as
independent variables to fit the model.}

\item{...}{[ANY]\cr
Additional parameters passed to \code{\link[ranger]{ranger}}. Ignored for the \code{print} method.}

\item{reg}{[\code{\link{Registry}}]\cr
Registry. If not explicitly passed, uses the default registry (see \code{\link{setDefaultRegistry}}).}

\item{x}{[\code{RuntimeEstimate}]\cr
Object to print.}

\item{n}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
Number of parallel jobs to assume for runtime estimation.}
}
\value{
[\code{RuntimeEstimate}] which is a \code{list} with two named elements:
 \dQuote{runtimes} is a \code{\link{data.table}} with columns \dQuote{job.id},
 \dQuote{runtime} (in seconds) and \dQuote{type} (\dQuote{estimated} if runtime is estimated,
 \dQuote{observed} if runtime was observed).
 The other element of the list named \dQuote{model}] contains the fitted random forest object.
}
\description{
Estimates the runtimes of jobs using the random forest implemented in \pkg{ranger}.
Observed runtimes are retrieved from the \code{\link{Registry}} and runtimes are
predicted for unfinished jobs.

The estimated remaining time is calculated in the \code{print} method.
You may also pass \code{n} here to determine the number of parallel jobs which is then used
in a simple Longest Processing Time (LPT) algorithm to give an estimate for the parallel runtime.

# We use the job parameters to predict runtimes

# First we need to submit some jobs so that the forest can train on some data.

# We "simulate" some more realistic runtimes here to demonstrate the functionality:
# - Algorithm "ncol" is 5 times more expensive than "nrow"
# - x has no effect on the runtime
# - If y is "a" or "b", the runtimes are really high
runtime = function(algorithm, x, y) {
