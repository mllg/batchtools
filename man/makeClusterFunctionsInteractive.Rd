\title{ClusterFunctions for Sequential Execution in the Running R Session}
\usage{
makeClusterFunctionsInteractive(external = FALSE, write.logs = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{external}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
If set to \code{TRUE}, jobs are started in a fresh R session instead of currently active.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{write.logs}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Sink the output to log files. Turning logging off can increase the speed of
calculations but makes it very difficult to debug.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
[\code{\link{ClusterFunctions}}].
}
\description{
All jobs executed under these cluster functions are executed
sequentially, in the same interactive R process that you currently are.
That is, \code{submitJob} does not return until the
job has finished. The main use of this \code{ClusterFunctions}
implementation is to test and debug programs on a local computer.

Listing jobs returns an empty vector (as no jobs can be running when you call this)
and \code{killJob} returns at once (for the same reason).
